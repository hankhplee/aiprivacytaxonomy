![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-v18.2+-61DAFB?logo=react)
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to Run The App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## How to Deploy The App


### `npm run build`
Run this commands first
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

Your app will now be deployed to the link: "https://hankhplee.com/aiprivacytaxonomy/#/aiprivacytaxonomy"
You can change this link in package.json


## Important Things to Note
First, when cloning the app and running npm install, you might get an error due to mui-style. Just install with --force to bypass the error.
Next, the Figma file will be passed along with this project and has all the designs needed. The screens you need are in the Figma page called "Final Screens"
Lastly, there is a hashtag symbol in the website URL due to having to use hash routing. I would suggest adding NextJS to this project to help avoid that in later iterations.
